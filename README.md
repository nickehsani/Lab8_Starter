# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I chose option 1: Within a Github action that run whenever code is pushed. This should make sure that any new code that is pushed to the project passes the basic tests necessary, and saves a lot of time and work.
2. No, for this you should use a unit test to see if it is giving you the correct output. End to end should be used to simulate an end user. 
3. No, you should use end to end testing instead as unit testing does not account for the user activity and behavior aspect of writing and sending a message to another user. E2E would test how the overall app and its connected components work together, making it a more suitable choice.
4. Yes, a unit test should be used to test the max message length feature. This feature is tied to a small single function and can be tested easily and unconnected from other components.
